<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
<p>
	SONAR is a client/server protocol designed for low-latency operation
	software. Its design is focused on addressing problems with other
	"standard" protocols, such as SOAP, CORBA, RMI or XML-RPC. These are
	some advantages:
</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Simplicity</dt>
	<dd>
		There are only 10 messages defined in the SONAR
		<a href="#wire">wire protocol</a>. These messages all apply to
		one simple <a href="#namespace">namespace</a>. Also, there are
		only a few basic attribute types. These facts are a
		<em>feature</em>, because simple software is much easier to
		audit for correctness. The full SONAR Java package is less than
		6000 lines of code, even with plenty of comments.
	</dd>
	<dt>Security</dt>
	<dd>
		All communication between client and server is encrypted using
		the industry-standard SSL (aka TLS) protocol. This prevents
		man-in-the-middle attacks, while keeping passwords secure as
		well. Actual user <a href="#auth">authentication</a> can be
		passed on to a separate LDAP server, so users do not need to
		remember multiple passwords, or keep different accounts in sync.
	</dd>
	<dt>Notification</dt>
	<dd>
		With these other protocols, there is no built-in way for a
		client to be notified when changes are made to objects. To
		provide this capability, clients must poll periodically for
		updates. Another option would be to have the client also act as
		a server, and have the real server perform callbacks when
		changes are made. This option is complicated and hard to debug.
	</dd>

<h2 id="basic">Basic Concepts</h2>
<h3 id="namespace">SONAR Namespace</h3>
<p>
	Each SONAR system has a simple namespace for uniquely describing
	objects. At the root of the namespace are the <em>object types</em>.
	Each object type is a container for all objects of that type. Each
	object has a unique identifier which, along with the type, constitutes
	the <em>object name</em>. Each type has a specific number of attributes,
	which are defined for every object of that type.
</p>
<pre>
	type_1
	type_1/object_A
	type_1/object_A/attribute_Z
	type_1/object_A/attribute_Y
	type_1/object_B
	type_1/object_B/attribute_Z
	type_1/object_B/attribute_Y
	type_2
	type_2/object_A
	type_2/object_A/attribute_X
	type_2/object_B
	type_2/object_B/attribute_X
</pre>
<h3 id="auth">Authentication and User Privileges</h3>
<p>
	Every SONAR namespace contains the <em>user</em> and <em>role</em>
	types. Each SONAR user must have a user object createed before logging
	in. Each user object is assigned a set of roles that the user can
	assume. A role consists of a name glob and a set of access flags.
	The name glob applies to names in the SONAR namespace, and the access
	flags (read, update, add, remove) define the privilege. All access to
	the SONAR namespace is denied unless one of the user's roles allows it.
</p>
<p>
	The actual user authentication is done by the SONAR server. It connects
	to an LDAP server, such as NDS or Active Directory to authenticate a
	user. Once a user is authenticated, all privilege information is
	handled by SONAR, not the LDAP server.
</p>
<h2 id="config">Configuration</h2>
<p>
	A SONAR server uses a standard Java properties file for configuration.
	The name of the file is dependant on the server using SONAR. There are
	four properties which must be defined.
</p>
<pre>
	# Example SONAR server configuration
	#
	# Keystore to use for SSL
	keystore.file=/etc/sonar/keystore
	# Keystore password
	keystore.password=********
	# List of LDAP URLs for authentication
	sonar.ldap.urls=ldaps://ldap.example.com:636 ldap://openldap.example.com:389
	# Port to listen for SONAR clients
	sonar.port=1037
</pre>
<dl>
	<dt>keystore.file</dt>
	<dd>
		The filename of a keystore in JKS format which contains the
		keys/certs needed for SONAR to operate. For example, a
		specific certificate may be needed to access an organizational
		LDAP server.
	</dd>
	<dt>keystore.password</dt>
	<dd>
		The password required to access the keystore referenced by
		the keystore.file property.
	</dd>
	<dt>sonar.ldap.urls</dt>
	<dd>
		List of URLs of LDAP servers to use for authenticating
		users. Each URL must be seperated by spaces or tabs.
	</dd>
	<dt>sonar.port</dt>
	<dd>
		The port to listen for SONAR client connections.
	</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="client">Client API</h2>
<p>
	The first thing a client must do to log in to a SONAR server is create
	a Client object. The constructor takes one parameter, a Properties
	object. The keystore.file property must be set to the location of a
	keystore file which contains an SSL certificate. The keystore.password
	property must contain the password to access that keystore file.
</p>
<p>
	Once a Client object is created, the user must log in. The login
	method on the Client object takes the user name and password as
	parameters. If the login method returns without throwing an exception,
	then the user has successfully logged in.
</p>
<p>
	After logging in, the client must create a TypeCache for each
	SonarObject type of which it wants to be notified. Each TypeCache must
	also be populated by passing it to the populate method of the Client
	object. This is an asynchronous operation; the method call will return
	immediately, and the TypeCache will be populated soon afterwards. Each
	TypeCache has a Map from object name to a proxy object of that type.
	This Map can be obtained by calling the getAll method on a TypeCache.
	All access to this Map must be synchronized on the Map object.
</p>
<h2 id="server">Server API</h2>
<p>
	A server using SONAR first needs to create a Namespace object. This is
	a container which holds all information published through SONAR. The
	namespace must be populated by adding objects which implement the
	SonarObject interface. There are two types which must be populated
	for any client to log in: User and Role.
</p>
<p>
	To allow the user/role information to be stored in a database, UserImpl
	and RoleImpl (found in the server subpackeage) must be subclassed. The
	create method should call a SQL INSERT. The destroy method should call
	a SQL DELETE. The setRoles and setDn methods of UserImpl should call a
	SQL UPDATE. The setPattern, setReadPrivilege, setUpdatePrivilege,
	setAddPrivilege and setRemovePrivilege methods of RoleImpl should call
	a SQL UPDATE as well.
</p>
<p>
	Once the Namespace is fully populated, a Server object can be created.
	This will start an SSL network server on a new thread. Another thread,
	called a ConnectionProcessor will also be created. All calls to change
	the Namespace will happen on this thread. This means that these calls
	should not need to be synchronized.
</p>
<h2 id="wire">Wire Protocol</h2>
<h3>Messages</h3>
<p>
	Messages are simple strings of UTF-8 characters.
	Each message is terminated with an ASCII RS (record separator) character
	(0x1E).
	There are only a few messages, each starting with its code (letter).
	After the code, there may be additional parameters, depending on the
	message.
	Each parameter is separated by an ASCII US (unit separator) character
	(0x1F).
</p>
<ul>
<li><em>CLIENT only</em>
<dl>
	<dt>l [name] [password]</dt>
	<dd>
		Logon to the SONAR server using the given credentials. If the
		authentication fails, an <em>s</em> message is returned by the
		server. Otherwise, an empty <em>t</em> message is sent.
	</dd>
	<dt>q</dt>
	<dd>
		Quit communicating with SONAR. This causes the session to be
		terminated and the socket closed.
	</dd>
	<dt>e [name]</dt>
	<dd>
		Enumerate all objects within the named container. If the name
		is a type, all objects of that type will be enumerated. If the
		name is an object, then all attributes of that object will be
		enumerated. The server will respond with a series of
		<code>o</code> messages, one for each object within the
		container. Also, for each object, a series of <code>a</code>
		messages will be sent, one for each attribute. The client will
		also update its watch set with the name. The watch set is
		checked any time changes are made, and the client is notified
		if necessary. If a name is not provided, all types will be
		enumerated. After all objects have been enumerated, a final
		empty <code>t</code> message will be sent by the server.
	</dd>
	<dt>i [name]</dt>
	<dd>
		Ignore any changes to the specified name. This will update the
		client's watch set for the specified name. A watch set can
		contain positive or negative entries, depending on the name.
		A name with only the type, or the type and object name is
		always a positive entry. A name with a type and attribute is
		always a negative entry.
	</dd>
	<dt>p [current-password] [new-password]</dt>
	<dd>
		Update the password for the currently logged-in user. First,
		the [current-password] is authenticated, and if successful,
		it is replaced with [new-password].
	</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><em>CLIENT and SERVER</em>
<dl>
	<dt>o [name]</dt>
	<dd>
		Add an object at the specified name. When a client sends this
		message, the name must be in the form of type/object. The server
		may omit the "type/" part if the current type [t] matches the
		type of the object.
	</dd>
	<dt>a [name] {[param 1] [param 2] ... [param N]}</dt>
	<dd>
		Set the value(s) of an attribute. When a client sends this
		message, the name must be in the form of type/object/attribute.
		The server may omit the "type/object/" part if the current type
		[t] and object [o] match for the attribute.
	</dd>
	<dt>r [name]</dt>
	<dd>
		Remove the specified object.
	</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><em>SERVER only</em>
<dl>
	<dt>t [name]</dt>
	<dd>
		Change the current working type. This allows relative names to
		be used in subsequent messages. Also, it allows a client to
		defer repaint operations until a later <code>t</code> message.
		This message is sent by the server after logon, and at the
		beginning and end of an enumeration. This will improve
		performance when there are hundreds of objects.
	</dd>
	<dt>s [text message]</dt>
	<dd>
		Show a warning or error message to user. This should cause
		a dialog box to appear on the client user interface. The first
		show message after logon is the client connection name.
	</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
