<h2>
<a NAME="DetsStats"></a>1. Detectors and Stations</h2>
DataExtract allows you to select either detectors or stations or a combination of the two.  You can select in a variety of ways.  They are:<br>
<ul>
<li>Type a valid index number into the search box and hit enter.
<li>Double-click the index in the available list.
<li>Highlight multiple entries in the list by using the control or shift
keys and then use the add button to add them all.
</ul>
<strong>Detector</strong> data
can be obtained by either an individual detector number or by a combination of
detector numbers ( Composite Detectors ).  See the <a href=
"dataplot.html">DataPlot Documentation</a>
for instructions on how to use Composite Detectors. <strong>Station</strong>
data can be represented by
an individual station number or by creating a composite detector. If station numbers
are input, they are converted to the composite detectors that represent station
data. You can also select detectors and stations by creating a text input file and then
importing it into DataExtract. The format for the file is quite simple.  One entry per
line.  If it is a detector number, preface the number ( or composite ) with the letter D
( capital or lower ). If it is a station number, preface the number with S.  That's all!
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h2>
<a NAME="Dates"></a>2. Dates</h2>
Date selection is done exactly as it is in DataPlot, but without the
limitations presented by plotting data.
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h2>
<a NAME="Data Sets"></a>3. Data Sets</h2>
There are a variety of data sets that can be extracted.  The raw data,
volume and occupancy, being two of those sets.  In addition to raw data,
you can get the aggregate data sets flow, headway, capacity, density and
speed.  For the formulas used in computing these sets, see the
<a href="dataplot.html">DataPlot Documentation</a>.
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h2>
<a NAME="Times"></a>4. Times</h2>
You can choose to select a full days worth of data or any fractional part
of a day ( down to minutes ).  DataExtract expects that times are entered
in 24 hour format and that you are selecting either hours or hours and
minutes.  If you attempt to select seconds, it will not be accepted.  The entry
can be of the formats:<br>
<ul><li>h<li>h mm<li>hmm<li>hh<li>hhmm<li>hh mm</ul>
You can choose any non-numeric character if you choose to separate the
hours and minutes ( e.g. hh:mm, hh mm, hh-mm etc... ).
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h2>
<a NAME="File Format"></a>5. File Format</h2>
<p>The data can be extracted into a variety of file formats, hopefully versatile
enough for most needs.  Based on the file format that you choose, the data
will be written to one or more files.  When a single-file format ( composite or
congestion) is chosen, you can declare the file name.  The file names will
automatically be generated for you when the multiple-file formats are chosen.
Whether you choose a single-file format or a multiple-file format, you must select
what data you want in the file(s).  The options are values and a variety of
aggregations of the values.  Although DataExtract is not designed as
a data manipulation tool, it was determined that certain aggregations of data
could be useful and so, were made available.  Please feel free to suggest
others that you think could be useful. Additionally, you can select how you
want the data oriented.  Essentially, this amounts to portrait or landscape.
Play around with it, you'll see what I mean.</p>

<h2>
<a NAME="Extracting"></a>6. Extracting</h2>
To extract the data, first make sure that you have selected at least one
date, detector, data set, time frame, and the necessary file information
has been provided.  From the file menu, choose "Extract Data".  It's that simple.
This produces a CSV ( comma separated values ) file.  It can then be
opened with most spreadsheet and database applications as well as any
text editor.
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h2>
<a NAME="Saving/Retrieving"></a>7. Saving/Retrieving</h2>
DataExtract can save and retrieve extraction settings to and from a file.  You will find these options on the file menu listed as "Save Settings As..." and "Open Settings File...".
