<h1>Density Calculation from Detector Data</h1>
In traffic data analysis, there are three related types of data: speed,
flow and density. <b>Speed</b> (miles per hour), is the best understood
of these types, and some sensing systems can directly measure it. <b>Flow</b>
is the rate in which vehicles arrive at a particular point on a roadway,
described in terms of vehicles per hour. Traffic sensing systems usually
record the traffic <b>volume</b>, which is the actual number of vehicles
to arrive during a sampling period (e.g.. 30 seconds). Volume can be easily
converted to a flow rate by multiplying the recorded volume by the number
of sampling periods in an hour. Density is a measurement of how close vehicles
are together, in vehicles per mile. With flow and speed measurements, density
is easily calculated by dividing the flow rate by the speed:
<p>Density (vehicles per mile)&nbsp; = Flow (vehicles per hour) / Speed
(miles per hour)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, older traffic sensing systems do not directly measure
speed. In many cases, sensors provide only volume and <b>occupancy</b>,
which is a percentage of time which the sensor is "occupied," by a vehicle.
This presents some difficulties in determining both density and speed.
Occupancy has a direct relationship to density, but that relationship is
also affected by the average vehicle length and the sensitivity of the
sensor. These two factors, taken together, are referred to as the <b>average
field length</b> of the traffic sensor (usually described in feet).</p>
<p>Once the average field length of a sensor is known, it is trivial to
convert occupancy data into density. Multiply the occupancy by the number
of feet in a mile (5280), to determine the number of occupied feet per
mile. Then divide the number of occupied feet per mile by the average field
length to determine the number of vehicles per mile (density).</p>
<p>To compute the average field length for a sensor, it is necessary to
take accurate speed and flow measurements, which can then be converted
to density. Then multiply the recorded occupancy from the same sampling
period by 5280 feet, to get the number of occupied feet per mile. After
that, divide the number of occupied feet per mile by the measured density
to determine the average field length for a sensor.</p>
