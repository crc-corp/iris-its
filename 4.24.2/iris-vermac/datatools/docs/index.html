<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Minnesota Department of Transportation collects traffic
 data on the freeway system throughout the Twin Cities Metro area. 
This data is archived and made available to the public via our
data tools, DataExtract and DataPlot.
<p><a href="dataplot.html">DataPlot</a> is a tool for graphing detector data.<br/>
<p><a href="dataextract.html">DataExtract</a> is a tool for extracting
detector data to a csv file for analysis.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.dot.state.mn.us/tmc/trafficinfo/downloads/adr.pdf">All Detector Report</a>
 can be used for locating detectors and stations.</p>
<p>It is recommended that you have at least 64 MB of RAM to run either application,
 preferably more. They have been tested on Windows 2000, Windows XP and
 Linux, but should work fine on any operating system which supports a
 current version of Java (1.4).</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
Install the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp">
Java Runtime Environment</a>. This must be
done by someone with local admin privileges.  If you attempt to install
it without proper privileges, the installation may fail.
 If you have trouble, take a look at the <a href="faqs.html">FAQS</a>
 for troubleshooting help.<br>

<h2>Running</h2>
To run <a href="DataPlot.jnlp">DataPlot</a> or <a href="DataExtract.jnlp">DataExtract</a>, simply click the link provided here.
<p>These applications require unrestricted network and PC access.  By design,
Java Web Start restricts this access.  You will be prompted to
allow unrestricted access but advised not to do so.  Disregard
this advise and click the "Start" button to allow access.
The applications require the Java Runtime Environment 1.4 or higher.  If you do not have it, you will be asked to install it.  This must be done by
someone with local admin privileges.  If you attempt to install
it without proper privileges, the installation will fail and you will
get a "bad installation" error.  See <a href="faqs.html">FAQS</a> for more troubleshooting help.  When successfully installed, you may start up the Java Web Start Application Manager and run it from there.<br>

<h2>NOTE</h2>
<p>If the calendar dates are all grayed out, it is likely because the 
application can't communicate with the data server.  If you are
 behind a corporate firewall, please make sure that
 TCP port 8080 is open.<br/>
<p>Please e-mail reports of problems to "data" at dot.state.mn.us.
