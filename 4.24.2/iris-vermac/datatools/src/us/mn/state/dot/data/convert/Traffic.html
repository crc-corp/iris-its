<h1>
MN/DOT Unified Traffic Data File Format</h1>
For many years, MN/DOT has collected traffic data from sensors (detectors)
embedded in the roadway. As of March, 2000, data is being collected every
30 seconds from more than 3500 detectors in the Twin Cities metro area.
This raw data consists of volume (number of vehicles, sometimes called
"flow") and occupancy (percentage of time a detector is "occupied"). As
you might guess, this adds up to a very large amount of data every day.
There is so much data that the advantages of storing it in a traditional
database are far outweighed by the complications. This data storage problem
led to the development of the MN/DOT <b>Unified Traffic Data File Format</b>.
<p>There are many benefits to the unified traffic data file format. Probably
the most important benefit is simplicity. Earlier file formats had complicated
bit field manipulation, which made it harder to develop data analysis tools.
This problem has been eliminated, since all data is stored as either 8-bit
or 16-bit binary integers. Another benefit is the compactness of the format.
In earlier formats, this quantity of data would occupy 33 megabytes (MB)
of disk space. In this format, the same data is compressed into about 13
MB (with no loss of precision). Another problem with earlier formats was
the distinction between 30-second, 5-minute, and station data made accessing
the data more complex than it needed to be. This format unifies all the
data into a single file, simplifying the software needed to access the
data. Another key benefit of the format is extensibility. It will be possible
in the future to add different types of data (such as speed) to the format
without sacrificing backward compatibility.
<p>Each traffic data file consists of one day's worth of traffic data.
The files are conventionally named with an eight-digit date (four-digit
year, two-digit month and two-digit day), plus an extension of ".traffic".
For example, a file called "20000323.traffic" would contain all the detector
data for March 23, 2000. The file itself is actually in the popular ZIP
compression format, making it easy to extract data using tools such as
WinZip. Within the traffic file, there are two files for each detector,
one containing the detector volumes for the whole day, and the other containing
occupancies. These files are named using the detector index number as the
base file name, with an extension of ".v30" (for volume), or ".o30" (for
occupancy). So, if there was a detector number 100, the traffic file would
contain two files, "100.v30" and "100.o30", (in addition to all the other
defined detectors).
<p>The volume files (*.v30) are flat binary files of 2880 bytes each. Each
byte is an 8-bit signed volume for the corresponding 30-second period in
the day. A negative value (-1) indicates missing data. The first 8-bit
value represents the first 30-seconds of the day (midnight to 12:00:30),
and the last value is the last 30-seconds of the day (11:59:30 to midnight).
<p>The occupancy files (*.o30) are in a very similar format as the volume
files, except each value is a 16-bit signed occupancy. Each file is 5760
bytes in length (2880 * 2). The occupancy values are fixed-point integers
ranging from 0 to 1000 (tenth of a percent units). A negative value (-1)
indicates missing data, as with the volume files. The 16-bit values are
in high-byte first order.
