<h2>Infinova Camera Control Code</h2>

<p>
	The Infinova IP camera has a simple TCP-based protocol which can
	encapsulate 3 different PTZ control protocols.
	These are the Infinova protocol, and the Pelco P and D protocols.
	Not much is known about the Infinova protocol, but use of either of
	the Pelco protocols is trivial.
</p>
<p>
	The wiper function can be controlled in two ways: aux 1 or preset 100.

<p>
	Each message to the camera must begin with a 12-byte header, as
	described in the table on the left.
</p>
</p>
	After connecting, the first message sent must be an "authentication"
	message (ID: 0x01), otherwise the camera will close the socket.
	For this message, the packet length (octet 11) should be 64 (0x40).
	The first 32 octets of the packet contents should be a "user name"
	field, in ASCII.
	The next 32 octets are apperantly a hashed password field.
	The user name and password are not checked by the camera, though,
	so they can have any values.
	Zero-filling these values is recommended.
	In captured data, there are 2 extra zero bytes appended after the
	authentication packet is finished.
	It is not known whether these bytes are required.

<p>
	After authentication, regular PTZ packets can be sent as needed.
	For these, the message ID is 0x13.
	The first 12-bytes of the packet contain a "PTZ header", which is
	probably determined by the protocol.
	This PTZ header is described in the table to the right.
</p>
<p>
	After the PTZ header, the raw protocol packet is sent unmodified.
	So, for Pelco D, seven bytes are sent for each packet.
